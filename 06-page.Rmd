I watched Dick all but plead with the hostess before he came back and said that it would probably be another twenty minutes now. This caused George and Kim to engage in a full fledged verbal brawl, drawing the attention from almost everyone in the restaurant. By this time Lisa and Jane had inched so far away from the bench they were practically in the bug-eyed couple’s booth and I had lost sight of Dick altogether. As I scanned the room, I noticed a waitress just to my left staring at George and Kim, completely ignoring the fresh tray of crème brûlée in her hands. I was torn between flat out attacking her and retaining my front row seat to the horrifically public airing of personal grievances. In the span of roughly thirty seconds, the whole restaurant had learned about what a terrible cook Kim was and George’s kleptomania and how Kim should have known marrying George was a mistake ever since he had cheaped out on the wedding. I was straining to hear about Kim’s secret lunch meeting with her high-school lover over what I would consider to be my stomach’s attempt to break the sound barrier when I saw the hostess heading in our direction. The look in her eye said we were about to be asked to leave and I saw my chance at that crème brûlée dwindling with each step. Almost at the exact second Kim screamed that she wanted a divorce, I pushed the hostess out of the way and lunged at the waitress’s tray, knocking both of us down in the process. I knew I didn’t have much time so I practically inhaled that sweet, sweet custard using my bare hands as spoons. All of my commotion caused George and Kim to stop screaming at each other long enough for everyone to redirect their attention to me. Without even looking, I felt another one of Lisa’s daggers hit me, only this time it was as if the deliciousness of the crème brûlée was my shield, protecting me from her visual lashing. I’m not sure if it was just because I was starving, but it really was the best crème brûlée I ever had the pleasure of tasting.
