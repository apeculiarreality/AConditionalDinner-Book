The entire restaurant seemed to freeze for a minute not knowing how to react until Dick walked back in and the hostess shouted at him that we all needed to leave immediately. Somehow, as the moving target, poor Dick had gotten the brunt of the hostess’s wrath despite having missed all of the drama unfolding. Kim miraculously managed to avoid it altogether as she had stormed out at some point while I was sitting frozen on the floor among all the other little dishes of custard from the waitress’s tray that had spilled over my pants. Lisa marched over and dragged me, still covered in crème brûlée, out to the parking lot. The others followed behind us- George beet red as ever, but now wheezing and clutching his left arm; Jane, speechless for the first time all night, looking like she had just witnessed a murder; and Dick in a state of confusion having missed all of the dramatics.
