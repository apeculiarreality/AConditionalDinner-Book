“She said it would just be a few more minutes.” Despite his patience, I could hear a hint of regret in Dick's voice, like a more polite version of my own.

I nodded gratefully at him, eyeing a fresh tray of crème brûlée. My stomach growled so loudly, I thought it had startled George until I realized he had only paused his latest rant to react to the little coaster pager they had given us. I grabbed it from him in what even I can admit was a somewhat hostile manner and took it up to the hostess.

“Party of six?”

I answered “yes” and gestured to my neighbors seated on the bench.

“Is everyone here? I only see five.”

“No, one person is running a little late.”

“I’m sorry, I can only seat full parties. If you let me know when she gets here, we can get you situated or I can change the table to five.”


I have to say at this point I was fairly disgusted with the whole thing and if not for that crème brûlée in the back of my mind, I would have walked out of that restaurant right then dragging Lisa behind me. But instead I walked back to the bench and explained in a tone that could only be described as accusing that we won’t be able to be seated until Kim arrives, spurring several expletives from George who was looking like a blotchy overfilled balloon that would burst at any moment. I’m no doctor, but his blood pressure must have been through the roof. Dick and Jane looked as if they wanted to shrink into oblivion and truthfully I wished they would have just so I had more room on that bench. Something had to make up for George’s swelling.
