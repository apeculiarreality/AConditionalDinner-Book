I lifted my chin from my fist and looked at my watch. Seven twenty-two. I tried to shift my weight on the hard, wooden bench in a futile effort to relieve my bottom which had started to go numb, though it was difficult as the five of us were practically on top of each other, packed on it like sardines. We had gotten to the restaurant right on time at seven o’clock and given our name to the hostess who had assured us it would be a twenty minute wait at most. George had commented the wait would be perfect since his wife, Kim, was always late anyway and then made up some story about how they had come separately because he had driven here straight from work. I knew perfectly well that was false because my kitchen happened to be the perfect place for me to listen to them fight for practically three weeks straight at every waking and non-waking hour, including tonight right before Lisa and I had left for the restaurant. Furthermore, just last Monday as I was preparing a particularly tasty pot roast for Lisa’s and my anniversary, I heard that George hadn’t even had a job in upwards of three months because he had gotten fired for stealing office supplies and “stayed home all day watching trashy daytime television yet couldn’t even be bothered to have dinner ready instead of applying for jobs.” I had been so enthralled in the dramatics, I completely lost track of time and was only reminded to put the roast in the oven by the gnawing feeling emanating from the bottom of my stomach.
