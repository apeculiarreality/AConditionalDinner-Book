It was now seven thirty-four and my stomach seemed to grumble louder each time a waitress came to seat another party, which would prompt a new insult about Kim from George. I had eaten a sizable lunch for someone with dinner plans, but for some reason I felt absolutely starved sitting on that bench. Most of the time I was meant to be making Year 2000 date expansion software updates today at work had been spent debating whether or not I would last long enough through the dinner to make it to dessert, but sitting there with George buzzing in my ear, it was almost to the point that trying the crème brûlée here was all I could think about. I had heard co-workers raving about it on several occasions and figured it was such an obscure dish for a relatively downmarket restaurant to have as a specialty that it must be particularly good. And sure enough, tray after tray of the most exquisite looking crème brûlée I had ever laid eyes on was being served to guest after guest as they finished their meals. I was honestly surprised at how divine those little white dishes of custard looked as the tacky mismatched decor and striped polo shirts did not exactly scream “Michelin star” to me. I watched as the somewhat lanky, but attractive, couple seated closest to our bench took their first bites, chewing with their mouths partially open to reveal little blobs of cream, rolling their heads around their giraffe necks as their eyes bulged out and making mouth noises. It should have repulsed me, but instead it made it seem even more tempting.
