George immediately declined, insisting he really should be getting home as he unsteadily traipsed to his car before driving off, in the opposite direction of the apartment building I might add. I had somehow been able to stop myself from yelling after him that he really should be going to get looked at instead, a feat of which I am still quite proud. 

Surprisingly, Lisa said that we should probably be going, too, and mumbled something to me about a “Mrs. Kennett” under her breath. But with the crème brûlée and excitement lining the bottom of my stomach coupled with my newfound admiration for Dick, I rather animatedly tried to convince her that waiting twenty minutes for a lousy burger was genuinely the greatest idea I had ever heard. Not wanting to cause any more of a scene, she reluctantly agreed on the condition that I apologize to the Johnsons for ruining their dinner and likely their chance at ever being allowed back. A part of me did feel genuinely bad that the rest of our party hadn't gotten the opportunity to have their way with that crème brûlée, and Jane in particular had been looking like she didn’t want to be anywhere within fifty feet of me, so I dutifylly expressed my regret over my behavior and somehow persuaded them to continue our evening. To tell the truth, I can be quite charismatic when I want to be and once I mentioned that I had a line as the apothecary in my high school’s production of Romeo and Juliet, even Jane started to warm up to me. On that note, we four remaining party members headed into Burgerland to again try our luck. I was sitting quite comfortably on the cushioned (cushioned!) bench next to Lisa, who was blotting the crème brûlée remnants on my pants with a tissue from her purse in a largely unsuccessful attempt to erase her embarrassment and avoid Jane’s never-ending list of ideas for the screen adaptation of The Notebook, which I’ll admit were fairly entertaining for one reason or another.
