It was only a moment later that Jane, as she was seated closest to the door, announced that she saw Kim walking in. Lisa later denied it, but I’m sure I saw her breathe a sigh of relief, grateful for a brief intermission in the terribly detailed description of the plot of a novel Jane was drafting, which sounded suspiciously similar to Pride and Prejudice to the extent that it featured a character named Mr. Darby. No sooner did Kim set one foot in the restaurant than George immediately sprung up and began to accuse her of making everyone starve to death. Before they could really get into it, Dick, who I was really starting to come around to, announced that he would let the hostess know everyone was here so we could be seated. I prayed that we would be so I could appease my stomach, which now seemed to be competing with George’s roars.
